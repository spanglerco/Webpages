<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>This online manual is intended to guide you through the process of learning how to create web pages. You do not need any prior knowledge about how web pages work or how web browsers know how an online document should look. However, if you do already have some knowledge of HTML, feel free to skip any of the sections. Each section will have a list of key points at the beginning to help you know what to expect from that section. Don't worry about understanding the key points before reading the section if the material is new to you. However, it is always a good idea to refer back to the key points before moving on to make sure you understood the section.</p>
<h3>Using This Manual</h3>
<p>Throughout this manual, you will see many examples, which are usually followed by an explanation. You are encouraged to use these examples as a base for writing your own web pages, and the first step towards understanding an example is to use it. Feel free to work your way from example to example through each section. One of the best ways to learn is by doing, so play around with the examples until you get something you like.</p>
<p>You can move on through the sections when you are ready, or just stop whenever you feel you are prepared to create your own web pages. At the bottom of every section are links to the next and previous sections. Using these links, you can read through the manual continuously. Or if you prefer, each section appears on the left side of the page, where you can skip directly to the information you are looking for. You can also use the search function in the upper-right corner of every page to find specific information anywhere in the website.</p>
